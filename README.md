# Online-Cookbook

This is an exercise in developing a MEAN (MySQL, Express, Angular, Node) stack website. To run locally, edit the config file "development" object so that you can connect to a MySQL Database and create a database called "onlineCookbook".

## Usage

This simple app currently allows users to create, read and delete recipes. You must enter a name, list of ingredients (as comma-sperated values), and directions to make the recipe. A rating is optional but will default to 0 in database. Users can also serach for all recipes that contain a specific ingredient. Simply enter the search term in the **Ingredient Search** input.
